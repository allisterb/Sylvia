# A Theory of Sets in Sylvia

Design and implementation notes for the Sylvia prover's theory of sets, following Gries &
Schneider, *A Logical Approach to Discrete Math*, **Chapter 11**. Companion to
[`prover-predicate-calculus.md`](prover-predicate-calculus.md) and
[`prover-automation.md`](prover-automation.md).

Runnable foundation check: `dotnet fsi examples/proofs/SetTheory.fsx`.

## 1. What Chapter 11 actually builds

Gries builds set theory in **two layers**, and the distinction drives the whole design.

### 1a. Foundational layer (§11.1–11.2) — sets over predicate calculus

Set theory is defined as an **extension of predicate calculus**. Everything is defined by
**membership**, and membership reduces to quantifiers:

| Ref     | Name              | Statement |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| (11.3)  | **Membership**    | `F ∈ {x | R : E} = (∃x | R : F = E)`  (provided ¬occurs 'x' 'F') |
| (11.4)  | **Extensionality**| `S = T = (∀x |: x∈S = x∈T)` |
| (11.5)  | —                 | `S = {x | x∈S : x}` |
| (11.7)  | Sets vs predicates| `x ∈ {x | R} = R` |
| (11.2)  | Enumeration       | `{e0,…,en−1} = {x | x=e0 ∨ … ∨ x=en−1 : x}` |

Each operator is then an axiom that **reduces membership to a connective**:

| Ref     | Operator      | Defining axiom |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| (11.12) | Size `#`      | `#S = (Σx | x∈S : 1)` |
| (11.13) | Subset `⊆`    | `S ⊆ T = (∀x | x∈S : x∈T)` |
| (11.17) | Complement `~`| `v ∈ ~S = v∈U ∧ v∉S` |
| (11.20) | Union `∪`     | `v ∈ S∪T = v∈S ∨ v∈T` |
| (11.21) | Intersection `∩` | `v ∈ S∩T = v∈S ∧ v∈T` |
| (11.22) | Difference `−`| `v ∈ S−T = v∈S ∧ v∉T` |
| (11.23) | Power set `𝒫` | `v ∈ 𝒫S = v⊆S` |

Sample proofs (e.g. 11.5) run through **Trading (9.19)** and the **One-point rule (8.14)** — pure
predicate calculus. So this layer is only expressible if the set theory sits *on top of* predicate
calculus.

### 1b. Algebraic layer (§11.3) — sets as a Boolean algebra

Definition (11.24) gives a syntactic translation between set expressions `Es` and boolean
expressions `Ep`:

```
∅ ↔ false      U ↔ true      ~ ↔ ¬      ∪ ↔ ∨      ∩ ↔ ∧
```

and **Metatheorem (11.25)** states: `Es = Fs` is valid iff `Ep = Fp` is valid; `Es ⊆ Fs` iff
`Ep ⇒ Fp`; `Es = U` iff `Ep` is valid. This is what hands you (11.26)–(11.42) — symmetry,
associativity, idempotency, identity, zero, excluded middle, contradiction, De Morgan,
distributivity — for free, i.e. `(set, ∪, ∩, ~, ∅, U)` is a Boolean algebra mirroring
`(bool, ∨, ∧, ¬, false, true)`.

## 2. How Sylvia models it

                    └─ (slot for) Membership 11.3, Extensionality 11.4, operator defs 11.12-11.23
```

### The ambient-logic insight

The proof engine already consults **both** the theory's axioms/rules **and** the ambient logic's
(`Proof.Logic`, permanently `Theory.S`): see `Proof.fs` — the completion checks
`theory |- state || logic |- state` and the step-rule validation unions `logic.Rules` with
`theory.Rules`. `Proof.Logic` is never reassigned, so **predicate calculus is available underneath
any theory for free**. `SetTheory` therefore does *not* need to re-inherit S; it already "extends
predicate calculus" simply by being used as a proof theory. This is verified by check (D) in
`examples/proofs/SetTheory.fsx` (a prop tautology `P ⇒ P` closes under `set_theory` via the
"Logical Axiom of Implication").

The remaining job is the *set* side: the Boolean-algebra operators (inherited) plus the
set-specific axioms (injected).

### Axiom / rule composition (the plumbing)

`Theory` takes a single `Axioms` function (`Expr -> AxiomDescription option`) with no built-in
merging. Previously `BooleanAlgebra` **declared** `?axioms`/`?rules` but hard-coded
`inherit Theory(boolean_algebra_axioms …, [fixed rules])`, silently **discarding** anything a
subclass passed — so `SetTheory` could not add membership/extensionality even if it tried.

Fixed by:

- **`combine_axioms extra base`** (`Theories/BooleanAlgebra.fs`): try the subclass's `extra`
  recognizer first, then fall back to the Boolean-algebra `base`. Injected axioms compose *over*
  the algebra rather than replacing it.
- The `BooleanAlgebra` constructor now threads `?axioms` (via `combine_axioms`), appends `?rules`
  **after** the seven built-ins (preserving the fixed indices `SetAlgebra` relies on), and forwards
  `?formula_printer`.
- `SetAlgebra` and `SetTheory` forward their optional `?axioms`/`?rules` with `?axioms = …` instead
  of collapsing them to `fun _ -> None`.

Verified by checks (A)/(B) in the foundation script: an injected marker axiom is recognized through
a `SetAlgebra(axioms = …)`, while the built-in algebra axioms still fire.

## 3. Complement-law correctness fix

While wiring the base, three related bugs in the inherited `BooleanAlgebra` complement law were
found and fixed (they would have silently produced **unsound** set reasoning):

- The `Inverse` axiom lines were inverted: they recognized `S ∪ ~S = ∅` and `S ∩ ~S = U`. Corrected
  to `S ∪ ~S = U` (11.32, excluded middle) and `S ∩ ~S = ∅` (11.39, contradiction).
- `_comp` (the admissible complement rule) had two identical `join` branches (the second dead) and
  produced the wrong constants; it now rewrites `a ∪ ~a → one` and `a ∩ ~a → zero`, splicing the
  constants (`%one`/`%zero`) instead of quoting the local bindings.
- `_left_assoc`'s fallthrough recursed with `(_left_assoc meet meet)` instead of `(join meet)`.

Check (C) confirms the corrected polarity is recognized and the inverted forms are rejected.

## 4. Status and plan

- **Step 1 — composition plumbing.** ✅ Done. `combine_axioms` + constructor threading;
  complement-law fix. Foundation script green (12/12).
- **Step 2 — the base theory.** ✅ Done. `SetTheory` sits over predicate calculus (ambient logic S)
  *and* the Boolean set algebra; both bases verified reachable. No re-inheritance of S needed.
- **Step 3 — foundational axioms.** ✅ Done. Added a symbolic comprehension builder `set_comp bound
  range body : Set<'t>` (mirroring `forall_expr`; the runtime `set`/`finite_set` constructors in
  `Set.fs` are 4-arg *value* constructors, not the 3-arg symbolic form the patterns need). Set-theorem
  arguments are symbolic **`SetVar`s**, so `ElementOf` now returns the *raw* set operand (it previously
  required a literal `Set`, so `x ∈ S` for a variable never matched); **Membership (11.3)** decomposes
  the comprehension itself via `SetComp`, and **Extensionality (11.4)** was rewritten for `SetVar`s
  (`S = T = (∀x|: x∈S = x∈T)`). Both are live, recognized axioms. Also fixed **One-Point (8.14)** in the
  predicate-calculus kernel (see below) and proved (11.5) and (11.7) as cross-layer smoke tests
  (`examples/proofs/SetTheory.fsx`, checks E–G).
- **Step 4 — operator axioms + the metatheorem.** ◐ Core done. Added the membership-reduction axioms
  **Union (11.20)** `v∈S∪T = v∈S ∨ v∈T`, **Intersection (11.21)** `v∈S∩T = v∈S ∧ v∈T`,
  **Complement (11.18)** `v∈~S = ¬(v∈S)`, **Subset (11.13)** `S⊆T = (∀x|x∈S:x∈T)` — all live,
  recognized, keyed on the SetTerm operator methods (`|+|`/`|*|`/`-`/`|<|`). Proved **11.28**
  `S ∪ S = S` via the membership route (extensionality → Union axiom → ∨-idempotency) and **De Morgan
  (11.42a)** `~(S∪T) = ~S∩~T`. Resolved the two coherence issues (§4a): union/intersection are keyed
  on the `|+|`/`|*|` operators in *both* the algebra and the membership axioms, so one `S |+| T`
  expression matches both routes, and `S ⊆ T` is now a proposition. See `examples/proofs/SetTheory.fsx`
  checks H–J.
- **Metatheorem (11.25a) tactic.** ✅ Done (equality fragment). A `metaset` tactic mechanizes the
  membership-route proof for *any* set identity over `{∪, ∩, ~, variables}`, proving each named
  law 11.26–11.42 with one call. See §4c and `examples/proofs/SetTheory.fsx` section K. Still open:
  Difference/Power set/Size (11.22/11.23/11.12 — the last needs a Σ quantifier); the ∅/U identity,
  zero, excluded-middle, contradiction laws (need `v∈∅ = false` / `v∈U = true` membership atoms —
  ∅/U are runtime values, not symbolic constants, so their recognizers are the missing piece); and
  Metatheorem parts **(b)** `Es ⊆ Fs ↔ Ep ⇒ Fp` and **(c)** `Es = U ↔ Ep` valid.

## 4a. Two coherence issues — resolved

- **Union/intersection representation.** ✅ Fixed by unifying on the `|+|`/`|*|` operators. Both
  `SetAlgebra` (join/meet) and the Union/Intersection membership axioms now key on
  `op_BarPlusBar`/`op_BarMultiplyBar`, so a single `S |+| T` expression written in the natural operator
  notation is recognized by *both* the algebra laws and the membership axioms. The key insight: a
  *type-annotated bare operator quotation* `<@ (|+|) : Set<'t> -> Set<'t> -> Set<'t> @>` is a direct
  method reference that `SpecificCall` accepts (and it resolves generically over the element type). Only
  an explicit *lambda* `<@ fun a b -> a |+| b @>` fails — that was the earlier red herring. The axiom
  patterns check `mi.Name = "op_BarPlusBar"` directly rather than via `Binary <@ (|+|) @>`, because
  `Binary`'s type guard would pin each axiom to a single element type. Complement already aligned
  (`-`/`Set.(~-)` both `op_UnaryNegation`). *(The earlier `sunion`/`sinter` combinators are gone.)*
- **Subset typing.** ✅ Fixed. The five `SetTerm.(|<|)` overloads (`Definitions/Set.fs`) now return
  `Scalar<bool>` instead of `SetTerm`, so `S ⊆ T` is a proposition. (`ssubset` is also provided.)

## 4b. De Morgan (11.42a)

`~(S ∪ T) = ~S ∩ ~T` is proved via the membership route (`examples/proofs/SetTheory.fsx` section J):
extensionality; the complement/union/intersection axioms reduce each membership; propositional
De Morgan (`distrib_not_or`, `¬(p∨q) = ¬p ∧ ¬q`) equates the sides; then reflexivity and
`(∀v|:true) = true`. It exercises all three Boolean operators together in one proof.

## 4c. Metatheorem 11.25(a) — the `metaset` tactic

Metatheorem (11.25a): a set identity `Es = Fs` is valid **iff** its propositional translation
`Ep = Fp` is valid, where Definition (11.24) maps `∅↦false, U↦true, ~↦¬, ∪↦∨, ∩↦∧`, and each set
variable `S` becomes its membership proposition `v∈S`. Rather than add this as a new *trusted*
primitive (which would import an out-of-kernel translation + validity oracle into the trusted base),
we **mechanize** the hand proof used for 11.28 / De Morgan, so every result is an ordinary
kernel-checked `Theorem` built only from the already-recognized axioms. The tactic
(`examples/proofs/SetTheory.fsx` section K) has three parts:

1. **`translate : SetTerm → Prop`** — Definition 11.24, structurally, keeping `v∈S` atoms for
   variables (`∪↦+`, `∩↦*`, `~↦!!`).
2. **`unfold : SetTerm → Rule`** — a rewrite `(v∈s) = translate s`, built by recursion that mirrors
   the operator axioms: at each node apply the Union/Intersection/Complement membership axiom
   (`id_ax`), then recurse into any *compound* operand (a bare variable is already an atom, so its
   step is skipped — avoids a no-op rewrite).
3. **`metaset lhs rhs : Theorem`** — apply **Extensionality** to get `(∀v|: v∈Es = v∈Fs)`; rewrite
   each side with its `unfold` lemma to reach the body `Ep = Fp`; prove `Ep = Fp` with the
   **complete** ANF prover `autoproof_anf` and fold it in with `Taut'` (replaces the body with
   `true`); close with `ident_forall_true'`.

Because `autoproof_anf` is complete for — and *only* for — propositional tautologies, `metaset`
proves exactly the valid identities over `{∪, ∩, ~, variables}` and **rejects** invalid ones
(`autoproof_anf` throws): section K checks both `S∪T = S∩T` and `~(S∪T) = ~S∪~T` are rejected.
Named laws proved by a single `metaset` call: **11.26/11.36** symmetry, **11.27** associativity,
**11.28** idempotency, **11.40/11.41** distributivity, **11.42a/b** De Morgan, absorption,
**11.19** double complement. This is the object-level payoff of §11.3 — the algebra laws "for free".

## 3a. One-Point (Gries 8.14) kernel fix

The (11.5)/(11.7) proofs reduce membership `∈` to an `∃`, which is then collapsed by One-Point. Two
bugs in `(|OnePoint|_|)` (`Patterns.fs`) blocked this (both latent — one-point was evidently never
exercised on predicate-application bodies):

- It substituted `P[x:=E]` with `subst_var_value`, whose `Application(a,x)` case replaces only the
  *function* position, leaving the argument — so `subst_var_value x e (R x) = R x`, not `R e`. Now uses
  `replace_var_expr` (general substitution). `subst_var_value` is unchanged (it is a beta-reduction
  helper used elsewhere).
- It only accepted the range `x = E` (dummy on the left), but membership yields `e = x` (dummy on the
  right) and there is no term-level equality-symmetry rule. It now accepts `E = x` as well; equality
  is symmetric, so this is a sound generalization of 8.14.

Verified: full prover suite 85/85 (no regression), and both set-theory smoke tests close.
